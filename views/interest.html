          <h2>Basketball</h2>
          <p>
            Personally, a huge fan of basketball, I barely watch the NBA since
            im more of a player, I played in my middle schoo-l team and plan on
            playing for varsity in 2021-2022 school year. I been praticing ball
            for roughly 5 to 6 years. I dont really plan on expanding in this
            skill, since im more into coding then basketball.

          <h2>Programming</h2>
          <p>
            I decided to become an ethical hacker when I was in my middle school
            years, but after I took a class of python I switched to software
            engineering. I loved the concept of it being clean and all the cool
            stuff you could do with it. Hacking was more like boring, because
            you cant really "SEE" what your program is actully doing. But still
            I leanred hacking with kali linux for about a week or so. I decided
            to put most of my time in coding and making projects. I code about 5
            to 6 hours a day.

          <h2>Cooking</h2>
          <p>
            My favorite hobby is cooking. I started when I was in middle school just for fun.
            After cooking some simple dishes. I fell in love with cooking too. 
            I started putting alot of my time creating my own recipes, as well as 
            copying others to learn. I only follow one chef, which is Vikas Khanna
            who is one of the best indian chef.
